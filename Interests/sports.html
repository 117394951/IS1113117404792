        	<p>I began surfing in the autumn when I joined the UCC Surf Club on their trip to Lahinch. A great weekend it was. I had surfed before but got a lot more interested after this trip. I am just back from the winter UCC surf trip in Taghazhout, Morocco. It was an unbelievable experience.The surfing was fantastic and some craic was had also. 80 'surfers' went over and we had an unforgettable week. </p>

        	<p>Active member of the UCC freshers team. Previosuly played for Wilton United but now playing my trade with the college. We are involved in the Munster Junior League, CUFL and we have the Harding Cup at the end of February. The Harding cup is the big comepition and is going to be held in DCU this year over 3 days. We have NUIG in our first game and if we get the better of them we will face either UCD or DCU in the semis. I personally am looking forward to this as it will not be only an exciting challenge but also a great experience.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align:center;color:black;">Photography</h3>
            <p>Have a keen interest in photography especially landscape.  I learned a lot from my Dad who was a former photographer and he was the reason why I start. Sunsets are my favourite as the colours are extremely vibrant. Sunsets will vary from day to day and that is why I find them so fascinating.</p>
